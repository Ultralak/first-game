This is the first game i made in godot

The inspiration i had for making this game ( or following this tutorial and changing some things ) is that i have been wanting to get into game dev for a while  
and frankly this engine is the only one i know that can run on my intel celeron (shhh don't tell anyone about that ok.. xD )  
I decided to start here because i am currently aspiring to be a solodev  

Now you may be asking ( soo what show us the game...) and to which i would say one, how rude and 2 its in the itch.io link  
what is it about i here you SCREAM: well you literally just collect coins. it is a relatively short level and as such you just have to dodge monsters and stuff  
so not to much hassle for the game gods out there with rtx 60 sth's (seriously i need a better laptop, this one sounds like a car when i code and it doesn't even have a fan (￣ ‘i ￣;)  
so enjoy the game if you want to ... or don't i can't force you  
on the itch.io for windows just download and run the exe  
for the others... i literally have no idea lol so i hate to say this but please figure it out  
pretty please with sprinkles on top  

this is the link to the tutorial i used for the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=4104s

Happy Hacking ╰(*°▽°*)╯
